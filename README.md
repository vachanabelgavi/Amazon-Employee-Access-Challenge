# Amazon-Employee-Access-Challenge

Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/amazon-employee-access-challenge

The purpose of the data analytics project is to predict if the employees are allowed or denied access to resources with the Amazon Database. Plotted graphs for seeing the trends in the dataset and similarity in test and train data. I used column transformations and methods for feature engineering. Feature Selection is performed using Recursive Elimination with Cross-Validation and built a few models, namely Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost, LightGBM and Catboost, for predicting the employees' access for a while. I have hypertuned the parameters for the models to check if they work better in the prediction.

Topics Covered (Interpretability, Statistical Inference)
1. Built different models to classify whether an employee will have access to the resources of the company based on different features impacting the decision.
2. The models were analyzed using SHAP and understand how the classification is taking place based on the features selected.
